Run the loginsignup.html file from localstorage in your preferred web browser. Ensure that the servers for your local machine are up and running.

Next, click on Create an Account to sign up with your name, email address and a password. Following this, you can log in successfully. 
The user's details are stored on the server. 

After successful login, We are redirected to the register page, where the user can fill in details like name, age, DOB and Contact which are stored in a different table.
The fields are validated, i.e. they cannot be left empty.

 Following this, the user is navigated to the profile page, where they can see the details in the server, and can update/edit this information as well..
The user also has an option to sign out here.
